Where we've been

	1996 - Active Server Pages (ASP)
	2002 - ASP.NET
	2008 - ASP.NET MVC
	2010 - ASP.NET Web Pages
	2012 - ASP.NET Web API, SignalR
	2014 - ASP.NET v.Next

What's wrong with the status quo?
	How many have .NET 4.5 installed on their servers?
	How many are able to install new versions on their web servers?
	.NET is a big thing (200MB)
		Http Context object (30k) newed up with each request
			(compatibility with classic ASP)
		Even ASP.NET itself carries a lot of baggage by default
		It's not modular - you get the kitchen sink
	Tied to Visual Studio, IIS

What's Next: ASP.NET v.Next  - 2014
	- 
	cloud-based abstractions (caching, etc...)
	config

No more System.Web (no more WebForms (in ASP.NET v.Next anyway))


Host Application (iis, katana, nowin, etc...)
CLR Framework (.net, k, mono)
Application Host (Microsoft.Host.Runtime, VS Designer)

K? Que?

CLI (Common Language Infrastructure)
	CLS (Common Language Specification)
	CTS (Common Type System)
	VES (Virtual Execution System) - CLR / k Runtime




Minimal v.Next app:
	project.json
	startup class
