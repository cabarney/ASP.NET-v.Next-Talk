Where we've been

	1996 - Active Server Pages (ASP)
	2002 - ASP.NET
	2008 - ASP.NET MVC
	2010 - ASP.NET Web Pages
	2012 - ASP.NET Web API, SignalR
	2014 - ASP.NET v.Next

What's wrong with the status quo?
	How many have .NET 4.5 installed on their servers?
	How many are able to install new versions on their web servers?
	.NET is a big thing (200MB)
		Http Context object (30k) newed up with each request
			(compatibility with classic ASP)
		Even ASP.NET itself carries a lot of baggage by default
		It's not modular - you get the kitchen sink
	Tied to Visual Studio, IIS

What's Next: ASP.NET v.Next  - 2014
	- MVC, Web API and Web Pages merged in to one framework: MVC 6
	- No dependence on System.Web
	- New cloud-optimized subset of the .NET Framework (11MB compared to 200MB)
		- Composed of NuGet Packages
		- Allows you to select and include only the components you want
	- Can deploy the framework with your app
		- side by side
		- insulated from changes on the server
		- update the framework on a per-app basis on your schedule (not IT's)
	- Host agnostic (IIS, self-host, mono) - WebAPI and SignalR were able to self host before, now MVC too
	- Dependency Injection is baked in
	- Uses Roslyn to compile code dynamically
	- Open source and on Github

	- New request pipeline
	- New project structure
	- New dependency management system
	- New configuration system
		- json, web.config, ini, custom (IConfigurationSource)

No more System.Web (no more WebForms (in ASP.NET v.Next anyway))


Host Application (iis, katana, nowin, etc...)
CLR Framework (.net, k, mono)
Application Host (Microsoft.Host.Runtime, VS Designer)

K? Que?

CLI (Common Language Infrastructure)
	CLS (Common Language Specification)
	CTS (Common Type System)
	VES (Virtual Execution System) - CLR / k Runtime




Minimal v.Next app:
	project.json
	startup class


MVC
	Before, Web Pages, MVC and API were all seperate
		team had to implement features twice
	Now unified
		DI-first
		Runs IIS or self-host
		Based on new v.Next requerst pipeline
	Major new version - breaking changes - upgrade path availble, but not free
	Still early!  HuBoard.com/aspnet.mvc
